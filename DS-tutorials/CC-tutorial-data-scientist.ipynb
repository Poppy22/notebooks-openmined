    "Data managers are PySyft users on behalf of companies, who are responsible for datasets. They can upload, edit and remove datasets. Most importantly, a data manager is the person who will share the login credentials with you in the first place, and and who will approve your code requests (also named code queries, or code submissions)."

    "Once you receive your credentials to log into the domain, you will be able to submit code queries, which will allow you to learn from the data. A code query can be seen as a function which will give you a desired answer (for example, the average rating for a post type, the highest/lowest value with specific criteria etc). We'll see how to send code queries in part (2) of this tutorial."

    "You won't directly have access to the private data. This is convenient for data managers, as they retain ownership of the data and prevent it from getting copied elsewhere. However, you will still be able to learn relevant statistical information from the dataset, even without having access to the data per se. This is good for data scientists like you, as you can still make use of the knowledge contained in the dataset and be able to advance your research. Win-win!"

    "\n",
    "Let's assume the data manager, approved your project request to study the dataset, and now you can start learning from it via code requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decide on a research question**\\\n",

    "\n",

    "Once you know your goal, you will start by preparing the query. You will only work on the mock dataset, the one from the low-side domain. The dataset will look and feel like the real one, but it won't contain the true data. You can make use of this to write and test your query, to make sure that the code compiles properly and returns an answer. You can edit and test your code query as many times as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submit the code request** (orange arrows)\\\n",
    "Once you are happy with the code query, then you can send it to be run on the real data. This is how you will get an accurate (but still privacy-friendly) answer for your research question. What happens here is that your code will be sent via PySyft API directly to the data manager. The data manager will check your code, make sure it is safe to be run on the real data, and if so, then they will execute your code on the private data, and generate the answer. This is why it's important that your code runs correctly when you decide to submit the code request - otherwise, the data manager will also be unable to run it and this will result in delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Get the answer** (orange arrows)\\\n",
    "After the data manager runs the code, they will also inspect the answer to make sure privacy is preserved if they share it with you. If all is fine, then they will send your the unaltered answer which your function returned on the private, real data. You will be notified when the answer is ready and will be able to retrieve this using the PySyft API.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the technical details will be explained in this tutorial, in part (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: because getting the real answer involves manual checks and execution on behalf of the data manager, this means that often the data scientist won't receive the answer right away, but it might be hours or even days later."
